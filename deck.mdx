# Why Use CSS Grid?

* We already have Flexbox to layout, align, and distribute dynamic content in user interfaces
* Flexbox is much better than floats, tables and other old-school layout techniques

---

# 2D in Nature

* Lets us layout interfaces in terms of columns and rows
* Better at handling complex layouts
* First CSS module created specifically to address layout problems we've been struggling with for years!

---
# Browser Support

<SplitLayoutLeft>
  CSS grid is now supported in Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox

  Internet Explorer 11 has partial support and uses an older version of the syntax

# Vocabulary

## Grid Track

* The rows and columns of the grid
* The space between two grid lines

---

# Vocabulary

## Grid Lines

* Dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid
* Are vertical and horizontal
* Are numbered by default but can also be named

---

# Grid Lines

* You define grid tracks; grid lines are automatically defined by the grid
* Allow us to position items in the grid
* Numbered direction is based on the writing mode of the page
* Can name lines to make positioning easier

---

# Vocabulary

## Grid Cell

* A single "unit" of the grid
* Similar to table cells

---

# Vocabulary

## Grid Area

* The total space surrounded by four grid lines
* Can be made up of any number of grid cells
* Doesn't have to represent all cells in a grid, but can

# Creating a Grid

Every grid starts with a parent container with the property `display: grid`

````css
.grid {
    display: grid;
}
````
````html
<div class="grid">
    I'm a grid!
</div>
````

<div style="display: grid;border: 1px dotted red;">I'm a grid!</div>

---

Easy, right? A one column grid isn't very interesting though, so let's add grid tracks!

---

# Specifying Grid Tracks

Remember, grid tracks are what hold your grid items.

We create these by setting `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` on the parent container.

````css
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 2fr;
    grid-template-columns: 25% 1fr 100px;
}
````
````html
<div class="grid">
    <div class="grid-item">Item 1</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 2</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 3</div>
    <div class="grid-item">Item 4</div>
</div>
````

<div style="display: grid;grid-template-rows:50px 2fr;grid-template-columns:25% 1fr 100px;border: 1px dotted red;">
    <div class="grid-item" style="border: 1px dotted red;">Item 1</div>
    <div class="grid-item" style="border: 1px dotted red;">Item 2</div>
    <div class="grid-item" style="border: 1px dotted red;">Item 3</div>
    <div class="grid-item" style="border: 1px dotted red;">Item 4</div>
</div>

# Creating Grid Items



---

# Implicit vs. Explicit Grid

* _Explicit_ grid is based on the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` you define
* If there's more content than there are defined rows and columns, then the grid creates rows and columns in the _implicit_ grid

---

# Implicit Grid

* The grid tracks in rows and columns in the _implicit_ grid are auto-sized by default based on their content
* The `grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-columns` properties define size of implicit grid tracks

---

# Track Size and `minmax()`

* `minmax()` specifies minimum grid track size for automatically created rows and columns
  * Still ensures that they expand to fit any content that's added
* Can use this when setting `grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-columns` properties

---

# Positioning Items Against Lines

* You target a __line__ when placing items, not a __track__
* Items are placed using the following properties:
  * `grid-column-start`
  * `grid-column-end`
  * `grid-row-start`
  * `grid-row-end`
* Don't need to specify `grid-row-end` if you want a grid item to span a whole row

---

# Grid Item Placement Algorithm

* Determines the order used for placing grid items in the grid
* Placement flow behavior is set with the `grid-auto-flow` property
* __Any grid item positioned to start or end on a line that goes in the same direction as the grid will be given priority placement. Everything else will flow around it.__

---

# Placement priorities:

1. Same-direction positioning (i.e., `grid-auto-flow: row | column`)
2. Order property (i.e., `order: 2`)
3. Document order

---

# `grid-auto-flow: row` (default placement)

* Items fill all of the slots in the current _row_ before starting to fill the next row
* Algorithm prioritizes any item whose __row start__ or __row end__ property is defined
  * Positions these items first. All of the other items are then flowed in around it using the normal flow
* Column positioning doesn't get priority with this flow setting
  * If an item has a column position, the browser will skip to the specified column. This can leave empty cells in the grid.

---

# `grid-auto-flow: column`

* Items fill up the current _column_ from top to bottom before starting to fill the next column
* Algorithm prioritizes any item whose __column start__ or __column end__ property is defined
* Row positioning doesn't get priority with this flow setting

---

# The `span` keyword

The `span` keyword will make grid items span multiple rows or columns, but doesn't increase their placement priority

---

# Order

* Can use `order` property to change the order of grid items, overriding the default document order placement
* Works just like Flexbox order, with items set to `order: 0` by default
* Giving a grid item `order: 1` makes it show up at the end
* Can move grid items to beginning with negative order (`order: -1`), also like Flexbox

---

# Order happens:
* _AFTER_ row start/end positioning (in `grid-auto-flow: row`)
* _AFTER_ column start/end positioning (in `grid-auto-flow: column`)
